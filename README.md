# aarc_idp_hint_preprod
This repository contains a list of Test IdP hints in aarc_idp_hint format that can be used when testing implementation of InAcademia's IdP Hinting feature (subject to appropriate licence grant).

# About IdP_hinting 
IdP_hinting is an extension to the InAcademia service that intends to assist merchants who are keen to optimise the number of clicks a user needs to make in validating academic affiliation at the point of sale or registration. By making a list of uniquely referenced IdPs available on a country-by-country basis, it is possible for the merchant to target specific institutions or subsets of institutions with specific campaigns.

The IdP Hinting feature is based on a list of supported academic institutions as announced to eduGAIN. When IdP hinting is used as designed by the merchant, it will allow Academia to directly route a user to the selected institution's login page, without the need for the user to select its preferred institution from an academic discovery service.

# Using this repo
This repo can be used to test an implementation of a drop down, prompt or list that consumes and automatically refreshes the institutions that are available for InAcademia validation.

Please refer to https://inacademia.org/oidc-implementation-for-inacademia/ and https://inacademia.org/inacademia-implementation-guidelines/ for more information on implementation, features, design and desired behaviours.

# Permitted use
